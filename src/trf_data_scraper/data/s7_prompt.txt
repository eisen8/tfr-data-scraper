You are a data annotator tasked with extracting relevant metadata from filenames related to anime, TV shows, and movies. For each filename provided, generate a JSON object containing annotations that classify the various pieces of information in the filename. Your annotations should include various labels such NAME, SEASON, EPISODE, EPISODE_TITLE, LANGUAGE< VIDEO_QUALITY, COMPRESSION, and other metadata labels. Each word in the filename should only be associated with a single label but there can be multiple instances of a label in a given output. Very generic metadata words like HD and Hi-Def can be ignored. If any label is not present in the filename, do not include it in the annotations.

Each annotation should consist of a "text" field containing the extracted value and a "label" field indicating the type of metadata. The text shouldn't include brackets or parentheses. Below is an example of how the output should be structured:
{
  "filename": "<original_filename>",
  "annotations": [
    {"text": "<extracted_text>", "label": "<metadata_type>"}
  ]
}

Here is a real example of an output:
{
  "filename": "Digimon - Digital Monsters - S02E07 - Guardian Angel (Dual-Audio 1080p 10bit HD DDP 2.0 BluRay AAC x265 Bluespots)",
  "annotations": [
    {"text": "Digimon - Digital Monsters", "label": "NAME"},
    {"text": "02", "label": "SEASON"},
    {"text": "07", "label": "EPISODE"},
    {"text": "Guardian Angel", "label": "EPISODE_TITLE"},
    {"text": "Dual-Audio", "label": "LANGUAGE"},
    {"text": "1080p", "label": "VIDEO_QUALITY"},
    {"text": "10bit", "label": "VIDEO_QUALITY"},
    {"text": "DDP 2.0", "label": "SOUND_QUALITY"},
    {"text": "BluRay", "label": "SOURCE"},
    {"text": "AAC", "label": "COMPRESSION"},
    {"text": "x265", "label": "COMPRESSION"},
    {"text": "Bluespots", "label": "RELEASE_GROUP"}
  ]
}

Here are the label types you will use:
- **NAME**: The name of the anime, TV show, or movie.
- **YEAR**: The release year. This should only be an integer. If a range of years is given, choose the start. For example, for "2020-2024" just use "2020".
- **SEASON**: The season number. This should generally only be an integer.
- **SEASON_PART**: Rarely a season will be released in parts. For example if it says "Season 1 Part 2" the season part is "2". This should only be an integer.
- **EPISODE**: The episode number. This should generally only be an integer but in rare cases might be something generic like "Opening 2".
- **EPISODE_TITLE**: The title of the episode.
- **LANGUAGE**: Anything related to language. Could be things like "Dual Audio" or "Multi-Sub" or specific languages like "Jap" or "Ita" or "Eng" or "Hindi"
- **VIDEO_QUALITY**: The video quality or resolution. This could include terms like "1080p" or "720p" or "10bit".
- **SOUND_QUALITY**: The sound quality, format, or configuration. This could include terms like "DDP 2.0" or "DDP5.1 Atmos" or "DTS 7.1"
- **COMPRESSION**: Any compression method used. For example: "x265".
- **SOURCE**: The source of the video. This could refer to the rip type or platform, such as "BluRay", "WebRip", "Hulu", "Amazon"
- **RELEASE_GROUP**: The user or group that uploaded the file. Could be things like "AnimeTime" or "Kingdom". Do not include brackets or parentheses.
- **OTHER**: Anything that doesn't fit in an above label but seems important. Do not include brackets or parentheses. This could be things like 8 or 16 character hashes included such as "ABDEFGAS".

Annotate each of the following filenames (separated by a newline) and put the outputs in a JSON list:
